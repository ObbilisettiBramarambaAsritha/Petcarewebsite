        <h1>This is out pet care center</h1>
        <p>
            Proper pet care is the basis of responsible pet ownership. It is important<br>
            when you adopt a pet to understand it is a lifetime commitment <br>
            to a furry family member that depends on you for his or her  <br>
            health and well-being. <br>
            Just like people, pets need food that meets their specific nutritional needs. <br>
            Dog foods are designed to meet a dog’s nutritional needs and cat foods  are<br>
            designed to meet a cat’s nutritional needs. Importantly, their dietary needs<br>
            are very different. Puppies require different food from senior dogs.<br>
            Pet’s with health issues  may require special diets. Table scraps are<br>
            typically not good for dogs and cats because many of the foods we eat, <br>
            such as salt, garlic, and onions are bad for your pet’s health <br>

                Hello, I'm Dannica! With 2 adorable Shih Tzus at my side while I work from home, their<br>
                company brings me pure joy. Caring for pets is my passion, and their companionship adds<br>
                so much happiness to my life.I have the delightful companionship of two adorable Shih Tzu dogs,<br>
                aged 4 and 2. Daily walks keep them happy and healthy, and my experience with them enriches the<br>
                care I offer to other pets.
